The framework consists of a suite of projects, tools, and libraries which may be used to build site-custom resource managers for High Performance Computing centers. Flux is a next-generation resource manager and scheduler with many transformative capabilities like hierarchical scheduling and resource management (you can think of it as \"fractal scheduling\") and directed-graph based resource representations.\n",

    "# The Flux Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "One feature of the Flux Framework scheduler that is unique is its ability to submit jobs within instances, where an instance can be thought of as a level in a graph. Let's start with a basic image - this is what it might look like to submit to a scheduler that is not graph-based,\n",
    "where all jobs go to a central job queue or database. Note that our maximum job throughput is one job per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img/single-submit.png](img/single-submit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The throughput is limited by the workload manager's ability to process a single job. We can improve upon this by simply adding another level, perhaps with three instances. For example, let's say we create a flux allocation or batch that has control of some number of child nodes. We might launch three new instances (each with its own scheduler and queue) at that level two, and all of a sudden, we get a throughput of 1x3, or three jobs per second. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img/instance-submit.png](img/instance-submit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of a sudden, the throughout can increase exponentially because we are essentially submitting to different schedulers. The example above is not impressive, but our [learning guide](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/learning_guide.html#fully-hierarchical-resource-management-techniques) (Figure 10) has a beautiful example of how it can scale, done via an actual experiment. We were able to submit 500 jobs/second using only three levels, vs. close to 1 job/second with one level. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img/scaled-submit.png](img/scaled-submit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And for an interesting detail, you can vary the scheduler algorithm or topology within each sub-instance, meaning that you can do some fairly interesting things with scheduling work, and all without stressing the top level system instance. Next, let's look at a prototype tool called `flux-tree` that you can use to see how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flux tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Flux tree is a prototype tool that allows you to easily submit work to different levels of your flux instance, or more specifically, creating a nested hierarchy of jobs that scale out. Let's run the command, look at the output, and talk about it."
