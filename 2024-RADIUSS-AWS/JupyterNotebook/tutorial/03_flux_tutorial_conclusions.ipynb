    "In this tutorial, we:\n",
    "* Introduced Flux\n",
    "* Showed how to get started with Flux\n",
    "* Showed how to perform traditional batch scheduling with Flux\n",
    "* Showed how to perform hierarchical scheduling with Flux\n",
    "* Described the structure of Flux instances and how that structure supports distributed services\n",
    "* Explained how to manage services with Flux\n",
    "* Showed examples of Flux services\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are ready for advanced content, you can do the [DYAD and DLIO tutorial](./supplementary/dyad/dyad_dlio.ipynb) and learn about:\n",
    "* Describing the design of DYAD, a Flux service for runtime data movement\n",
    "* Introducing distributed Deep Learning (DL) training\n",
    "* Introducing Argonne National Laboratory's Deep Learning I/O (DLIO) benchmark\n",
    "* Using DLIO to show how DYAD accelerates distributed DL training\n",

    "And don't worry, you'll have more opportunities for using Flux! We hope you reach out to us on any of our [project repositories](https://flux-framework.org) and ask any questions that you have. We'd love your contribution to code, documentation, or just saying hello! üëãÔ∏è If you have feedback on the tutorial, please let us know so we can improve it for next year. \n",

    "\n",
    "Feel free to experiment more with Flux here, or (for more freedom) in the terminal. You can try more of the examples in the `flux-workflow-examples` directory in the window to the left. If you're using a shared system like the one on the RADIUSS AWS tutorial please be mindful of other users and don't run compute intensive workloads. If you're running the tutorial in a job on an HPC cluster... compute away! ‚öæÔ∏è\n",

To run this tutorial on your own, you can clone this repo, enter the directory for the version of the tutorial you want to run, and follow the instructions in that directory's README. All versions of this tutorial are designed to either be deployed to cloud (e.g., AWS) or be run locally using Docker.\n",
