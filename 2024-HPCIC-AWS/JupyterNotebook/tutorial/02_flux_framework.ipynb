    "Now that we have learned about basic flux commands, and hierarchical scheduling and its benefits, let's dive deeper into the structure of the individual Flux instances that comprise a hierarchy and talk about some additional \"plumbing\" that helps Flux to run. In this module, we cover:\n",

    "## The structure of Flux instances\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in [Chapter 2](./01_flux_tutorial.ipynb), a Flux instance is comprised of one or more Flux brokers. A high-level depiction of the design of a Flux broker is shown in the figure below.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each broker is a program built on top of the ∅MQ networking library. The broker contains two main components. First, the broker implements Flux-specific networking abstractions over ∅MQ, such as remote-proceedure call (RPC) and publication-subscription (pub-sub). Second, the broker contains several core services, such as PMI (for MPI support), run control support (for enabling automatic startup of other services), and, most importantly, broker module management. The remainder of a Flux broker's functionality comes from broker modules: specially designed services that the broker can deploy in independent OS threads. Some examples of broker modules provided by Flux include:\n",
    "* Job scheduling (both traditional and hierarchical)\n",
    "* [Fluxion](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched) (Flux's advanced graph-based scheduler)\n",
    "* Banks and accounting (for system-wide deployments of Flux)\n",
    "* [PMIx](https://github.com/openpmix/openpmix) (for OpenMPI)\n",
    "* An in-memory content store (useful for preloading data into pods on cloud)\n",
    "\n",
    "When Flux starts, it launches one or more brokers across the resources it manages. By default, Flux will launch one broker per node, but this can be configured (e.g., with the `--test-size` flag to `flux start` shown in [Chapter 1](./01_flux_tutorial.ipynb)). After launching the brokers, Flux will designate one broker as the \"leader\" and the rest as \"followers\". The leader serves as entrypoint into the Flux instance, and it serves as the starting point for most Flux commands. The distribution of brokers and the \"leader-follower\" designations are shown in the following figure:\n",

    "<img src=\"img/flux-instance-pre-tbon.png\">\n",
    "<figcaption>\n",
    "<i>Image created by Vanessa Sochat for Flux Framework Components documentation</i></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "After launching the brokers and designating a leader, Flux uses the brokers' network abstractions to connect the brokers together into what we call the \"tree-based overlay network\" or TBON for short. This network is shown in the figure below. This overlay network connects brokers together in a pre-defined tree-based topology (e.g., *k*-ary and binomial). Whenever brokers or instances of distributed services running on top of the brokers need to communicate, they can send messages up and down this tree-structured network. This tree-structured network is used over alternative designs (e.g., all-to-all networks used by MPI) because it provides better scalability (by minimizing communication), security, and fault tolerance for a service-focused framework. More information about these benefits and Flux's overall design can be found in our [publications](https://flux-framework.org/publications/) (particularly our [2014 paper on Flux](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7103433) presented at ICPP).\n",

    "\n",
    "Flux functionality can be extended with modules, which you might think of like services. For Flux instances, additional services are typically implemented as broker modules that can be deployed across one or more brokers. Once deployed, these services can leverage the other components of the broker, including message routing over the TBON and services provided by other broker modules. As a result, broker modules allow for the creation of composable, easily deployable services for Flux instances."
