    "# DYAD\n",
    "\n",
    "DYAD is a synchronization and data movement tool for computational science workflows built on top of Flux. DYAD aims to provide the benefits of in situ and in transit tools (e.g., fine-grained synchronization between producer and consumer applications, fast data access due to spatial locality) while relying on a file-based data abstraction to maximize portability and minimize code change requirements for workflows. More specifically, DYAD aims to overcome the following challenges associated with traditional shared-storage and modern in situ and in transit data movement approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of per-file object synchronization in shared-storage approaches\n",
    "* Poor temporal and spatial locality in shared-storage approaches\n",
    "* Poor performance for file metadata operations in shared-storage approaches (and possibly some in situ and in transit approaches)\n",
    "* Poor portability and the introduction of required code changes for in situ and in transit approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "In resolving these challenges, DYAD aims to provide the following to users:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Good performance (similar to in situ and in transit) due to on- or near-node temporary storage of data\n",
    "* Transparent per-file object synchronization between producer and consumer applications\n",
    "* Little to no code change to existing workflows to achieve the previous benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate DYAD's capabilities, we will use the simple demo applications found in the `dyad_demo` directory. This directory contains C and C++ implementations of a single producer application and a single consumer application. The producer application generates several files, each consisting of 10, 32-bit integers, and registers them with DYAD. The consumer application uses DYAD to wait until the desired file is produced. Then, if needed, it will use DYAD to retrieve the generated files from the Flux broker on which the producer application is running. Finally, the consumer application will read and validate the contents of each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, specify which versions of the producer and consumer applications you would like to use by setting the `producer_program` and `consumer_program` variables. There are two versions for the producer (i.e., `c_prod` and `cpp_prod`) and two versions for the consumer (i.e., `c_cons` and `cpp_cons`)."
