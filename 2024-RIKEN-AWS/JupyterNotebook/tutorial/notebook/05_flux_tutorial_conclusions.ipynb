    "Don't worry, you'll have more opportunities for using Flux! We hope you reach out to us on any of our [project repositories](https://flux-framework.org) and ask any questions that you have. We'd love your contribution to code, documentation, or just saying hello! 👋️ If you have feedback on the tutorial, please let us know using the following form: so we can improve it for next year: https://forms.gle/GRSE79JhwDXd1T7B9\n",

    "Feel free to experiment more with Flux here, or (for more freedom) in the terminal. If you want to learn about several other useful features and commands in Flux, you can take a look at the supplemental [Module 6](./06_supplement.ipynb). You can also try more of the examples in the flux-workflow-examples directory one level up in the window to the left. If you're using a shared system like the one on the RADIUSS AWS tutorial please be mindful of other users and don't run compute intensive workloads. If you're running the tutorial in a job on an HPC cluster... compute away! ⚾️\n",

    "All materials for this tutorial (including other versions of the tutorial) can be found in our [Tutorials repo](https://github.com/flux-framework/Tutorials). To run this tutorial on your own, you can clone this repo, enter the directory for the version of the tutorial you want to run, and follow the instructions in that directory's README. All versions of this tutorial are designed to either be deployed to cloud (e.g., AWS) or be run locally using Docker.\n",
