The Jupyter Notebook runs some scripts from the flux-workflow-examples
repository, so please ensure that a clone of this exists in the same location
as the ECPTutorial.ipynb notebook. 

git clone https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples.git

Docker instructions are in the docker-script file.
Note that in some cases the flux start command may not work from the Jupyter 
notebook and may have to be run within the terminal before utilizing the
notebook.
