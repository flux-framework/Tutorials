    "Flux is a flexible framework for resource management, built for your site. The framework consists of a suite of projects, tools, services, and libraries which may be used to build site-custom resource managers for High Performance Computing centers. Flux is a next-generation resource manager and scheduler with many transformative capabilities like hierarchical scheduling and resource management (you can think of it as \"fractal scheduling\") and directed-graph based resource representations.\n",

    "This tutorial is split into several notebooks:\n",
    "* [Module 1: Getting started with Flux](./01_flux_tutorial.ipynb) (the rest of this notebook)\n",
    "* [Module 2: Traditional and hierarchical schedulinng using Flux](./02_flux_scheduling.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Module 3: TBA](./03_flux_framework.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Module 4: Accelerating Distributed Deep Learning (DL) Training with DYAD](./dyad_dlio.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Module 5: Conclusions](./05_flux_tutorial_conclusions.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "To go through this tutorial, you need to go through these notebooks in the order above. To step through examples in each notebook you need to execute cells. To run a cell, press Shift+Enter on your keyboard. If you prefer, you can also paste the shell commands in the JupyterLab terminal and execute them there.\n",

    "The main unit of interaction with Flux is the **Flux instance**. A Flux instance consists of a collection of **Flux brokers**. These brokers are connected together and deploy a fully functional set of services which manage compute resources under its domain with the capability to launch jobs on those resources. A Flux instance may be running as the default resource manager on a cluster, a job in a resource manager such as Slurm, LSF, or Flux itself, or as a test instance launched locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "When run as a job in another resource manager, Flux is started like an MPI program, e.g., under Slurm we might run `srun [OPTIONS] flux start [SCRIPT]`. Flux is unique in that a test instance which mimics a multi-node instance can be started locally with simply `flux start --test-size=N`. This offers users to a way to learn and test interfaces and commands without access to an HPC cluster.\n",
