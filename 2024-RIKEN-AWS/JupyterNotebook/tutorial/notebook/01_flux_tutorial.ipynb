    "Flux is a flexible framework for resource management, built for your site. The framework consists of a suite of projects, tools, services, and libraries which may be used to build site-custom resource managers for High Performance Computing centers. Flux is a next-generation resource manager and scheduler with many transformative capabilities like hierarchical scheduling and resource management (you can think of it as \"fractal scheduling\") and directed-graph based resource representations.\n",

    "The main unit of interaction with Flux is the **Flux instance**. A Flux instance consists of a collection of **Flux brokers**. These brokers are connected together and deploy a fully functional set of services which manage compute resources under its domain with the capability to launch jobs on those resources. A Flux instance may be running as the default resource manager on a cluster, a job in a resource manager such as Slurm, LSF, or Flux itself, or as a test instance launched locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "When run as a job in another resource manager, Flux is started like an MPI program, e.g., under Slurm we might run `srun [OPTIONS] flux start [SCRIPT]`. Flux is unique in that a test instance which mimics a multi-node instance can be started locally with simply `flux start --test-size=N`. This offers users to a way to learn and test interfaces and commands without access to an HPC cluster.\n",
